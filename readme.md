# Featherweight Virtual Machine

This repo is a fork of the [Featherweight Virtual Machine project hosted at 
Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fvm-rni/).

Featherweight Virtual Machine (FVM) is an OS-level virtual machine for Windows 
2000 and XP. FVM virtualizes Windows' file system, registry, kernel
object, and network communication.

## Building

Building FVM requires the following:

* Microsoft Visual Studio 6 with VC++ compiler
* Microsoft Detours Express 2.1
* Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK)

## License

Both the original FVM project and all of my modifications are released under
